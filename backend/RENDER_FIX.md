# üîß Render Deployment Fix

## ‚ùå Issue Identified:

- Missing `email-validator` dependency for Pydantic EmailStr validation
- Heavy ML dependencies (transformers, torch) causing deployment timeouts

## ‚úÖ Solutions:

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)

Use the updated `requirements.txt` with `email-validator` added:

```bash
# The requirements.txt has been updated with email-validator
# Redeploy on Render - it should work now
```

### Option 2: Lightweight Deployment (If still failing)

If the deployment still times out due to heavy dependencies, use the lightweight version:

1. **Rename files temporarily:**

   ```bash
   mv requirements.txt requirements-full.txt
   mv requirements-light.txt requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render** (much faster build)

3. **Restore after successful deployment:**
   ```bash
   mv requirements.txt requirements-light.txt
   mv requirements-full.txt requirements.txt
   ```

### Option 3: Disable Sentiment Analysis Temporarily

If you want to deploy quickly without sentiment features:

1. **Comment out sentiment imports** in `news_analysis.py`
2. **Return dummy sentiment scores**
3. **Deploy successfully**
4. **Add ML features later**

## üöÄ Immediate Action:

The `requirements.txt` has been fixed with `email-validator`. Try redeploying on Render now.

## üìã Updated Environment Variables:

```bash
PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.0
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/stocksage
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=901831058444-aulhp05opla5c42a6vr3srkljh0kdei0.apps.googleusercontent.com

CORS_ORIGINS=https://stock-market-dashboard-psi.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173

The main issue was the missing `email-validator` - this should fix the deployment! üéØ
